## Technical Scope (from SRS)

## Risk Flags

1. **Dr. Senthil previously disengaged** - proceed with leverage, not eagerness
2. **8-month timeline is aggressive** for scope described
3. **30+ FTE peak** - staffing capacity check required
4. **RMSI wrote the specs** - they know the inside game; could be advantage or liability
5. **Tender not yet published** - do not commit resources until independently verified
